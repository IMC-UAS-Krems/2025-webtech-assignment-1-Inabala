        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have a wide range of interests that keep me motivated and inspired.
          Technology and digital innovation fascinate me, especially how they can improve people’s daily lives.
          I enjoy photography and creating aesthetic visuals that express emotion and simplicity.
          Exploring new places and learning about different cultures are passions I actively pursue, especially now as an Erasmus student in Austria.
          Back home in Albania, I work in an optical store, which has helped me develop strong communication and customer service skills.
          Being the Chairperson of my Faculty Student Council allows me to practice leadership, teamwork, and organizational abilities.
          I am also passionate about personal well-being and health, building habits that support both body and mind.
          These experiences have shaped me into a confident, adaptable, and motivated individual ready to take on new challenges.</p>
