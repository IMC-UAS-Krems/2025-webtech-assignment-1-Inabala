                <p>My name is Ina Bala, and I am an Erasmus student from Albania currently studying  Informatics in Austria.
                I am passionate about learning, creativity, and finding ways to make technology useful in everyday life.
                Back in my home country, I serve as the Chairperson of my Faculty Student Council, where I lead and organize various academic and social activities.
                People describe me as organized, empathetic, and driven to make a positive impact in everything I do.
                I enjoy balancing my studies, work, and personal passions while constantly aiming to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
